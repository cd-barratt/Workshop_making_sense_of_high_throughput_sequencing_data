# Workshop_making_sense_of_high_throughput_sequencing_data
This is the basis of a couple of workshops I ran at iDiv in May and October 2019. 
The aim was to familiarise people with the planning of a RAD-seq/ddRAD-seq project (main considerations and pitfalls to avoid), and to provide some initial analytical help to enable processing and analysis of the data once available.
